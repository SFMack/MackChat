# MackChat
MackChat is a project that I built to help understand web sockets. Web sockets allow the retrieval of data in realtime making them perfect for a chat feature within other applications or as a standalone application

## Functionality
tbc

## Status
Complete

## Tech
Socket.io | React | CSS

## Bugs
None

## How To Use
1. Type your name and the name of the room you want to enter/start 
2. Share the name of that room with another person and have follow the same steps; making sure they use the same room name
3. You should then see the other person in the chat room and as well as notifications to keep users informed

## Plans for the future
Implement the ability to display all active chat rooms that are available to join
Hide some rooms based on privacy settings and only allow authorized users to view and enter that chatroom
